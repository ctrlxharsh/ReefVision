## Project Rules for ReefVision

Inherits all global rules with the following mandatory project-specific rules:

### 1. Push to GitHub on Completion of Every Step
On completion of every development step, task, bug fix, or milestone:
- Verify the implementation first (**Implement → Test → Fix → Re-test**).
- Check `git status` to ensure clean staging without unintended files.
- Commit all changes with a clear, descriptive commit message.
- Push immediately to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
  *(or the active working branch).*

### 2. Workspace Monorepo Structure
- `Streamlit App/`: Streamlit web/local application for coral segmentation and reef analysis.
- `Tauri App/`: Next-generation Tauri v2 desktop application with React UI and FastAPI backend.
- `AGENTS.md`: Workspace rules and conventions.
- `.agents/skills/`: Workspace-specific agent skills.

### 3. Binary & Weight Handling
Never commit heavy machine learning model weights (`*.onnx`, `*.pth`, `*.pt`, `*.bin`), installers (`*.dmg`, `*.pkg`, `*.exe`), or virtual environments/dependencies (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`). Keep `.gitignore` strictly maintained.
